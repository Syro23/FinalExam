In this repository you can find the code for a program that manages the books of a bookshop called "Libros para todos"

This program follows an architecture system called MVC, it means that we use a controller, a view and a model
- The model will manage the collection of books saving them by its name, author, category and availability.
- The view will show the respective options to the user such as which is the name of the book that he will search or the author of the book, and it will also allow the user to reserve, purchase or return a book. Also it     will show the user the respective book that he was searching for.
- The controller will search, in the model, for the respective book that the user is searching for using the data that the user introduced in the view.

This is the respective UML diagram:
